Wordsmith is a small SwiftUI/SwiftData that allows you to store and group words and associated 
definitions. It will ultimately be a multi-platform app, but currently only works properly on macOS (v 14.0 or later). 
Once I've got iOS support up and running, I intend to enhance its feature set to create an App Store compliant 
vocabulary builder.
